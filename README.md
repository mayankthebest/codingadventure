# Orchestrator Tool
This tool helps you to perform common tasks like Copy files/folders, Delete files/folders, Find and Replace in files, Restart Windows Service, Start a process - but all on remote machines! You of course need to have access to those machines to perform these tasks.

This tool also helps you chain together tasks and also save a sequence of tasks for reuse.
